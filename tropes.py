# How about a table per category?
# > SQLite does not support joins containing more than 64 tables...
# > So one could not query a Trope belonging to more than 64 categories...
# How about one hot encoding?
# There is a hard limit of 32,767 columns in any sqlite table...
# The default setting for SQLITE_MAX_COLUMN is 2000
# You can change it at compile time to values as large as 32767
# SQLite does not have a separate Boolean storage class so we burn a signed int per value...
# > One hot encoding rather than references in other tables.
# How about storing as a bitfield?
# > This limits the number of categories drastically and obfuscates their meaning...
# How about a compound key on a categories table i.e. (id, category)?
# It seems like we have a winner!

# The functions map, filter are examples of lazy iterators AKA generators as they yield rather than return.
# The any, all, sorted, enumerate, or constructors such as list, will execute the iterator/generator.
# The function zip takes iterables and is iteself an iterable i.e. is lazy.
# The itertools module contains a number of commonly used iterators as well as functions for combining several iterators.
# The operator module contains a set of functions corresponding to Pythonâ€™s operators.
# The functools module contains some higher-order functions e.g. the functools.partial(), .reduce() functions.
